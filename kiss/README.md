# Kubernetes Is Simple, Stupid

Kubernetes makes it easy and efficient to manage resources in your clusters. Of course, this does not pertain to hardware resources that you airlift yourself!

For automated multi-site deployment of cloud-native on-premise (edge) clusters, you can run high-performance, real-time operations called `D.N.A` (aka. Data, Network, AI). However, in order for `D.N.A` to be managed automatically, easily and efficiently, you need to do extra work on Kubernetes directly. Are you capable of professional cluster fine-tuning?

[KISS](https://github.com/SmartX-Team/netai-cloud/tree/master/kiss) has appeared to solve these concerns. **Simply deploy and enjoy a self-managed edge clusters!** Also, join the [IPI Ecosystem](https://github.com/ulagbulag-village/ipis) to share and utilize the world's computing resources. The SaaS you create can be realized and accelerated anywhere, from embedded to KISS-based HPC, including mobile, depending on its resource requirements.

## Note

`KISS` is a part of `NetAI Cloud` , which is the research result of [GIST's `NetAI` Laboratory](https://netai.smartx.kr/), led by [**Ho Kim**](https://github.com/kerryeon) under professor [**JongWon Kim**](https://netai.smartx.kr/people/professor). That is, this package is operated for academic purposes, and there is **No commercial support in this package**.
