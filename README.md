# NoA Cloud

[Not only AI Cloud](https://github.com/SmartX-Team/noa-cloud) is a kind of Open-Source IaC (Infrastructure as Code) that supports individuals or organizations to freely integrate and operate their own or well-known (i.e. Amazon AWS) distributed resources.

`NoA Cloud` is designed to be fully compatible with the [IPI Ecosystem](https://github.com/ulagbulag-village/ipis).

`NoA Cloud` utilizes [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and Linux kernel. In some cases, it utilizes kernel bypassing technology that allows direct access to high-speed PCI devices such as `GPU` , `NPU` and `DPU` for performance. The results of these works can be applied from embedded including mobile to HPC areas through the `IPI Ecosystem` .
