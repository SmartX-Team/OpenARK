# OpenARK

[OpenARK](https://github.com/SmartX-Team/openark) is a kind of Open-Source IaC (Infrastructure as Code) that supports individuals or organizations to freely integrate and operate their own or well-known (i.e. Amazon AWS) distributed resources.

`OpenARK` is designed to be fully compatible with the [IPI Ecosystem](https://github.com/ulagbulag/ipis).

`OpenARK` utilizes [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and Linux kernel. In some cases, it utilizes kernel bypassing technology that allows direct access to high-speed PCI devices such as `GPU` , `NPU` and `DPU` for performance. The results of these works can be applied from embedded including mobile to HPC areas through the `IPI Ecosystem` .

## Note

`OpenARK` was designed to be used for research of [GIST's `NetAI` Laboratory](https://netai.smartx.kr/), led by [**Ho Kim**](https://github.com/kerryeon) under professor [**JongWon Kim**](https://netai.smartx.kr/people/professor).
